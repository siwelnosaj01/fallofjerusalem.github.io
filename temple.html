							<h2>Jerusalem and the Temple</h2>
							<p><br />
						<h3 class="quote">"And when foreigners hear of you and come from distant lands to worship your great name- for they will hear of you and of your mighty miracles and your power- and when they pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven where you live, and grant what they ask of you. Then all the people of the earth will come to know and fear you, just as your own people Israel do. They too will know that this temple I have built bears your name." <br><i>- Dedication by Solomon of the temple in Jerusalem (1 kings 8:41-43)</i></h3>

								Put yourself in the sandals of a Jewish person preparing to journey to Jerusalem to celebrate one of the three festivals of the year. Who will go with you? Your entire family of course. What provisions will you take for the trek? What will you bring to offer at the temple? What dangers will you face on the road? In the following psalms of ascent these questions and more are reflected on, and in many cases answered. Yet the profound assurance of God's everlasting care for Israel will soon meet the forces of Rome, who will succeed in tearing down the temple. No Ark of the Covenant, no successor to David, no temple, no Jerusalem, no country. We look forward then with the pilgrims, but backwards with the exiles.
