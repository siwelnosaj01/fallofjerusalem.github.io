							<h2>Jerusalem and the Temple</h2>

						<h3 class="quote">"And when foreigners hear of you and come from distant lands to worship your great name- for they will hear of you and of your mighty miracles and your power- and when they pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven where you live, and grant what they ask of you. Then all the people of the earth will come to know and fear you, just as your own people Israel do. They too will know that this temple I have built bears your name." <br><i>- Dedication by Solomon of the temple in Jerusalem (1 kings 8:41-43)</i></h3>

								The temple in Jerusalem, before its destruction was the highest expression of a long history of humankind's attempt to appease God. When Noah exited the ark, his first act was to build an alter and sacrifice on it. This was acceptable to God and the first covenant was made with all humanity. But humanity rejected the alter of Noah so built the tower of Babel. Later, God called Jacob, through the covenant with Abraham, to establish Israel embodied in twelve sons who became twelve tribes. At Sinai, Moses delivered God's instructions for both approach and appeasment. Laws were given and a tabernacle established to be the point of contact between God and his people. When the children of Israel conquered and inhabited Canaan, the tabernacle was always considered temporary until Jerusalem was finally in the possession of Israel. King David brought the ark to Jerusalem and designed the temple, though was not to be the one to build it. Solomon completed all of his father's designs and erected the first temple within Jerusalem.
