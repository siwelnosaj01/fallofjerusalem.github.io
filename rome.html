							<h2></h2>
							<p>It is difficult for a modern person to understand the centrality of the Jewish temple for Jewish life. Three times a year, and most importantly at Passover, Jewish families would travel to the temple for redemption- and this redemption provoked the most sincere and joyous response. Jesus took great joy in the temple and its future destruction lay on him the heaviest of all. Wasn't he to be found in his father's house? The zeal for the house of the Lord consumed him to the point of violent anger. He wept over Jerusalem because of the great carnage that would come.
								<br>
								<br>
								Put yourself in the sandals of a Jewish person preparing to journey to Jerusalem to celebrate one of the three festivals of the year. Who will go with you? Your entire family of course. What provisions will you take for the trek? What will you bring to offer at the temple? What dangers will you face on the road? In the following psalms of ascent these questions and more are reflected on, and in many cases answered. Yet the profound assurance of God's everlasting care for Israel will soon meet the forces of Rome, who will succeed in tearing down the temple. No Ark of the Covenant, no successor to David, no temple, no Jerusalem, no country. We look forward then with the pilgrims, but backwards with the exiles.
