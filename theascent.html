							<h2></h2>
							<p>It is difficult for a modern person to understand the centrality of the Jewish temple for Jewish life. Three times a year, and most importantly at Passover, Jewish families would travel to the temple for redemption- and this redemption provoked the most sincere and joyous response. Jesus took great joy in the temple and its future destruction lay on him the heaviest of all. Wasn't he to be found in his father's house? The zeal for the house of the Lord consumed him to the point of violent anger. He wept over Jerusalem because of the great carnage that would come.
								<br>
								<br>
								Put yourself in the sandals of a Jewish person preparing to journey to Jerusalem to celebrate one of the three festivals of the year. Who will go with you? Your entire family of course. What provisions will you take for the trek? What will you bring to offer at the temple? What dangers will you face on the road? In the following psalms of ascent these questions and more are reflected on, and in many cases answered. Yet the profound assurance of God's everlasting care for Israel will soon meet the forces of Rome, who will succeed in tearing down the temple. No Ark of the Covenant, no successor to David, no temple, no Jerusalem, no country. We look forward then with the pilgrims, but backwards with the exiles.

								<h2>THE ASCENDING PSALMS 120-134</h2>

								<h2>Psalm 120</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"I took my troubles to the Lord, I cried out to him, and he answered my prayer. Rescue me, O Lord, from liars and from all deceitful people. O deceptive tongue, what will God do to you? How will he increase your punishment? You will be pierced with sharp arrows and burned with glowing coals. How I suffer among these scoundrels of Meshech! It pains me to live with these people from Kedar! I am tired of living here among people who hate peace. As for me, I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										In this first of fourteen psalms of ascent, the pilgrim first intends to concentrate his disgust with the wicked and their nations. Starting from the cesspool of heathen nations and thier violence, the oncoming of the temple in Jerusalem will become sweeter. 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 121</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"I look up to the mountains- does my help come from there? My help comes from the Lord, who made the heavens and the earth! He will not let you stumble and fall; the one who watches over you will not sleep. Indeed, he who watches over Israel never tires and never sleeps. The Lord himself watches over you! The Lord stands beside you as your protective shade. The sun will not hurt you by day, nor the moon at night. The Lord keeps you from all evil and preserves your life. The Lord keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										The pilgrims look to the mountains through which they will journey. What dangers await? Maybe water will run out, and food. Deadly snakes and insects, larger, preditory animals will need to be guarded against. Gangs of robbers surely infest the mountain passes. Where will we look for help? It is to the Lord who watches over all- my family, my enemies, the animals. Even the sun will not get the better of us, nor the lunacy of night. We will not stumble, we will not fall. God will guard us against all evil. 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 122</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem. A psalm of David.</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"I was glad when they said to me, 'Let us go up to the house of the Lord.' And now we are standing here; inside your gates, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a well-built city, knit together as a single unit. All the people of Israel- the Lord's people- make their pilgrimage here. They come to give thanks to the name of the Lord a the law requires. Here stand the thrones where judgement is given, the thrones of the dynasty of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. May all who love this city prosper. O Jerusalem, may there be peac within your walls and prosperity in your palaces. For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, 'Peace be with you.' For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										The pilgrims are arrived inside the gates. The legacy of David is before us in the strong gates and mighty temple. But the world is so chaotic; the world is full of threats and wicked people. Want for peace; hope for peace; Pray! Pray for the peace of this holy city. For my mother and father, for my children, for our friends may there always be peace in Israel. 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 123</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"I lift my eyes to you, O God, enthroned in heaven. We look to the Lord our God for his mercy, just as servants keep their eyes on their master, as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal. Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy, for we have had our fill of contempt. We have had our fill of the scoffing of the proud and the contempt of the arrogant."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										The temple of God is very great. The throngs of people who gather around the temple are hushed by a solemn reality- God is with us. None of us look to God with presumption; we look to God with hope. What will be God's verdict towards us? We beg for mercy. We find no mercy from the proud and arrogant. They only scoff at us with contempt. Only in the presence of our God can we find our dignity. God with us raises us above our enemies- let them laught at us now! 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 124</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem. A psalm of David.</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"If the Lord had not been on our side- let Israel now say- if the Lord had not been on our side when people rose against us, they would have swallowed us alive because of their burning anger against us. The waters would have engulfed us; a torrent would have overwhelmed us. Yes, the raging waters of their fury would have overwhelmed our very lives. Blessed be the Lord, who did not let thier teeth tear us apart! We escaped like a bird from a hunter's trap. The trap is broken, and we are free! Our help is from the Lord, who made the heavens and the earth."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										The threats are real. Didn't Babylon seem to sweep our nation away? When our nation was restored then the Greeks surged against us. Evil leaders arose and nearly consumed us. The surrounding people hoped for our disaster- they laid traps for our destruction. But here we are! In your temple, presenting ourselves and our children before your throne. Yes, we are free! Help does come from the Lord!

								<h2>Psalm 125</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"Those who trust in the Lord are as secure as Mount Zion; they will not be defeated but will endure forever. Just as the mountains surround and protect Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds and protects his people, both now and forever. The wicked will not rule the godly, for then the godly might be forced to do wrong. O Lord, do good to those who are good, whose hearts are in tune with you. But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O Lord. Take them away with those who do evil. And let Israel have quietness and peace."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										Who are those who trust in the Lord? Who are his people? Are there crooked people among our own? Those with hearts out of tune with your heart O God? Take them away with the rest of the evil ones. Purge Israel so peace will prevail. 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 126</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"When the Lord restored his exiles to Jerusalem, it was like a dream! We were filled with laughter, and we sang for joy. And the other nations said, 'What amazing things the Lord has done for them.' Yes, the Lord has done amazing things for us! What joy! Restore our fortunes, Lord, as streams renew the desert. Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy. They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										How have we emerged from catastrophe to laugh and sing songs of joy? Our testimony is true- when we planted with tears in our eyes but hope in our hearts, the harvest was gathered with shouts of joy. Does not our many offerings of livestock and produce testify that we are living the dream? The nations around us can only wonder at the change. But we know our God is working for us. 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 127</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem. A psalm of Solomon.</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"Unless the Lord builds a house, the work of the builders is useless. Unless the Lord protects the city, guarding it with sentries will do not good. It is useless for you to work so hard from early morning until late at night, anxiously working for food to eat; for God gives rest to his loved ones. Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him. Children born to a young man are like sharp arrows in a warrior's hands. How happy is the man whose quiver is full of them! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										Everything is a gift from the Lord. Everything. The nations around us think they will preserve their lives by hard work and industry. The nations take refuge in strong warriors and diligent watchmen. Heathen farmers work restlessly in hopes of food to eat; even their children are multiplied in anxiety. But for the loved ones of God, we recieve all things as a gift- our houses, the safety of our city, the produce of our fields, the children we bear. The wicked cannot argue away our gifts. 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 128</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"How happy are those who fear the Lord- all who follow his ways! You will enjoy the fruit of your labor. How happy you will be! How rich your life! Your wife will be like a fruitful vine, flourishing within your home. And look at all those children! There they sit around your table as vigorous and healthy as young olive trees. That is the Lord's reward for those who fear him. May the Lord continually bless you from Zion. May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live. May you live to enjoy your grandchildren. And may Israel have quietness and peace."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										We must dwell further on the gifts of the Lord. Do they come as a result of our industry? Is it because we follow the ways of the nations around us that we prosper? No! We follow the ways of the Lord and fear him. The rewards are incalcuable for those who fear God. The rewards will transfer to our children and their children. All of Israel will be made strong, quiet and peaceful. Peace to guard all the rewards we take joy in. How can we fail? 
									</p>
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2>Psalm 129</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me, but they have never been able to finish me off. My back is covered with cuts, as if a farmer had plowed long furrows. Buth the Lord is good; he has cut the cords used by the ungodly to bind me. May all who hate Jerusalem be turned back in shameful defeat. May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop, turning yellow when only half grown, ignored by the harvester, despised by the binder. And may those who pass by refuse to give them this blessing: 'The Lord's blessing be upon you; we bless you in the Lord's name.'"</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										Should we be so obsessed about our enemies? They deeply hurt us, even killed some of us, but should we not forgive them? Amidst our prosperity, in the shadow of our temple, before our children can we forget what our enemies did to us? The Lord's blessing stops in our throat; only the curse is ready for those who stepped on us in our time of weakness. May our enemies never gain a foothold over us again.

								<h2>Psalm 130</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"From the depths of despair, O Lord, I call for your help. Hear my cry, O Lord. Pay attention to my prayer. Lord, if you kept a record of our sins, who, O Lord, could ever survive? But you offer forgiveness, that we might learn to fear you. I am counting on the Lord; yes, I am counting on him. I have put my hope in his word. I long for the Lord more than sentries long for the dawn. O Israel, hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is unfailing love and an overflowing supply of salvation. He himself will free Israel from every kind of sin."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										Ah! Enough about our enemies. What about us? Can we face holy God with our own history of sin? Do we stand any better than our enemies if God pours out his wrath against us? Wait. We have something our enemies don't have. We have a future. God forgives our sins that me might learn...that we might learn to fear him. Just like any father who disciplines his children, our God disciplines us because we have a future. A future within his house. That we may act like children of God.  
									</p>
								</p>
								<h2>Psalm 131</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem. A psalm of David.</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I don't concern myself with matters too great or awesome for me. But I have stilled and quieted myself, just as a small child is quiet with its mother. Yes, like a small child is my soul within me. O Israel, put your hope in the Lord- now and always."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										How do we act like children before our Father? We quiet ourselves; not bother ourselves about matters that cannot be influenced by us. We stay still and wait in the shadow of our parent who watches over us. A vigilant parent who keeps watch over us agaist all threats. Can such a child be proud and haughty? Such a child is all depending on the provision and care of their parent. So we are in the house of our God. The temple is not just safety to us; the temple is a warning. Be quiet child, you are watched and guarded.
									</p>
								</p>
								<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"Lord, remember David and all that he suffered. He took an oath before the Lord. He vowed to the Might One of Israel. 'I will not go home; I will not let myself rest. I will not let my eyes sleep nor close my eyelids in slumber until I find a place to build a house for the Lord, a sanctuary for the Mighty One of Israel.' We heard that the Ark was in Ephrathah; then we found it in the distant countryside of Jaar. Let us go to the dwelling place of the Lord; let us bow low before him. Arise, O Lord, and enter your sanctuary, along with the Ark, the symbol of your power. Your priests will be agents of salvation; may your loyal servants sing for joy. For the sake of your servant David, do not reject the king you chose for your people. The Lord swore to David a promise he will never take back: 'I will place one of your descendants on your throne. If your descendants obey the terms of my covenant and follow the decrees that I teach them, then your royal line will never end.' For the Lord has chosen Jerusalem; he has desired it as his home. 'This is my home where I will live forever.' he said. 'I will live here, for this is the place I desire. I will make this city prosperous and satisfy its poor with food. I will make its priests the agents of salvation; its godly people will sing for joy. Here I will increase the power of David; my anointed one will be a light for my people. I will clothe his enemies with shame, but he will be a glorious king.'"</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										Written before the first temple was destroyed by Babylon, David is king, and his line is secure as long as the people follow the Lord. The Ark of the Covenant is inside the temple, though recently returned from Philistia. Now we look to the great temple this Idomean, this non-Jewish King Herod has built. Glorious, indeed. But inside there is no ark, only a rock. Our leaders are religious professionals, not the stock of David. But God will never abandon Jerusalem and his temple. We will grasp the promise of an anointed one, a light for the people who will be king. Messiah is still to come.

								<h2>Psalm 133</h2>
								<p><i>A song for the ascent to Jerusalem. A psalm of David.</i></p>
								<p>
									<i>"How wonderful it is, how pleasent, when brothers live together in harmony! For harmony is as precious as the fragrant anointing oil that was poured over Aaron's head, that ran down his beard and onto the border of his robe. Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon that falls on the mountains of Zion. And the Lord has pronounced his blessing, even life forevermore."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										The time has passed and we are preparing to leave Jerusalem. Our host provided all we needed during our stay here: beds for our families, food and water, a friendly word and a blessing. Yes, harmony for our community comes from the words of the Lord. Those who follow his commands will live in peace with others and their enemies. May we return to our villages with this harmony. May we ever live with our neighbors as friends.

								<h2>Psalm 134</h2>

								<p>
									<i>"Oh, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, you who serve as night watchmen in the house of the Lord. Lift your hands in holiness, and bless the Lord. May the Lord, who made heaven and earth, bleass you from Jerusalem."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										We leave the temple in your care brothers. We must return to our homes far from Jerusalem, but may God continue to bless your sacrifices, day and night, on our behalf. Pray clean hands will raise to heaven as a witness to your holiness. May holiness flood our nation and the nations admit, there is no other like our God.
