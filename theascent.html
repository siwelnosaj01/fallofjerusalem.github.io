							<h2></h2>
							<p>It is difficult for a modern person to understand the centrality of the Jewish temple for Jewish life. Three times a year, and most importantly at Passover, Jewish families would travel to the temple for redemption- and this redemption provoked the most sincere and joyous response. Jesus took great joy in the temple and its future destruction lay on him the heaviest of all. Wasn't he to be found in his father's house? The zeal for the house of the Lord consumed him to the point of violent anger. He wept over Jerusalem because of the great carnage that would come.
								<br>
								<br>
								The closest a Christian might approach the catastrophe of the loss of the temple would be to have the world-wide church of Jesus be snuffed out in a moment. Have the devil appear with a captured Christ and declare the church outlaw and command its destruction. No more gathering with the saints, no more hope for remeption, no songs of joy, no confidence in a soveriegn God to save us.

How will he increase your punishment? You will be pierced with sharp arrows and burned with glowing coals. How I suffer among these scoundrels of Meshech! It pains me to live with these people from Kedar! I am tired of living here among people who hate peace. As for me, I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war."</i>

									<p class="commentary">
										In this first of fourteen psalms of ascent, the pilgrim first intends to concentrate his disgust with the wicked and their nations. Starting from the cesspool of heathen nations and thier violence, the oncoming of the temple in Jerusalem will become sweeter.
